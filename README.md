Vue.JS Task for Developers applying for the position of Javascript Developer

We love people who like learning new things and thinking in the abstract. This task (hopefully) helps you discover and few new services and help illustrate some of your front end skills to us.

Here's what you need to do:

1) Clone this repository. (DO NOT PUBLICLY FORK IT)

2) If you are forking it, make it a private fork and add h@wipadika as a member of the repository.

3) Go to Vue.JS[https://vuejs.org] and learn a bit about it (Don't spend more than 10 minutes there)

4) This repository has a HTML file and it's corresponding assets. You will have to implement Vue.JS

5) There is a Calendar on this page, You will need to make the Calendar pull events from the REST API using Vue.JS

Here is the REST API, https://vtask-cba5b.firebaseio.com/Events.json

Make sure any new event added to the REST API is rendered properly on the calendar. Each type of event should be a different color.

6) Once done, Host the page on AWS S3.

7) Send me the link on h+VTask@wipadika.com with the subject of the email as "[Vue Task] Your Full Name"

All the Best
